# moves

**Area of research**  
How is conversational coherence negotiated dynamically through topical moves, discourse cues, and conversational state?

**Research question**  
How do discourse moves (reach-back, drift-relevant, forward-irrelevant), moderated by **segue presence** and **topical potential** (active vs dying), influence human judgments of coherence and repair behaviors?

**Stimuli types**

1. **Reach-back** — references a user topic several turns earlier.
2. **Drift (relevant)** — introduces a semantically adjacent, related topic.
3. **Forward (irrelevant)** — introduces a new, unrelated topic.

All can appear with/without a **segue** and under **active vs dying topical potential**.

**Observables**

* **Acceptability rating (1–7 Likert)** — how coherent/acceptable the turn feels.
* **Repair behavior (categorical)** — continue / ask clarification / correct bot / ignore / switch topic / leave
* **Response latency** — time to respond after the bot’s turn.
* **Optional short free-text explanation** — reason for rating/behavior.

**Revised hypotheses**

* **H1 (Segue effect):** Segue increases acceptability across all moves, strongest for drift.
* **H2 (Topical potential):** Shifts (drift/forward) are more acceptable when topic is dying; reach-back is less acceptable when topic is dying.
* **H3 (Direction effect):** Drift may be most acceptable overall; acceptability interacts with topical potential and segue.
* **H4 (Repairs):** Continuation without repair indicates acceptability; forward-irrelevant triggers ignoring or topic switches; reach-back triggers clarification; drift continues smoothly if segued.
